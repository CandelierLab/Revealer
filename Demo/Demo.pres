--- How does it work?

<a href="https://revealjs.com/" target="_blank">Reveal.js</a> formats presentations for web browsers <br> <br>

Watch the demo for an introduction ðŸ˜€ <br>

--- Which text editor?

Any text editor will do the job <br> <br>

But <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VScode</a> is a good companion editor <br>
with the <code>Run on save</code> and <code>Live Server</code> plugins

=== The interface is highly controllable

Try the key bindings! <br><br>

* Slide navigation: Arrows
* Zoom: Ctrl + Click
* Full screen: F / ESC
* Speaker's view: S
* Slide overview: ESC

--- This template is highly customisable

* Change content and structure
* Include your own logos
* Develop your own features

--- Export to pdf
> visibility: hidden

You can export to pdf by adding <code>?print-pdf</code> <br> to the presentation's URL <br>

<pre><code class="codeblock">
path/to/my/pres/index.html?print-pdf
path/to/my/pres/index.html?print-pdf&showNotes=true
</code></pre>

<br>

Or simply <a href="">click here</a> <br>
