   abstract = {Organisms have increased in complexity through a series of major evolutionary transitions, in which formerly autonomous entities become parts of a novel higher-level entity. One intriguing feature of the higher-level entity after some major transitions is a division of reproductive labor among its lower-level units in which reproduction is the sole responsibility of a subset of units. Although it can have clear benefits once established, it is unknown how such reproductive division of labor originates. We consider a recent evolution experiment on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a unique platform to address the issue of reproductive differentiation during an evolutionary transition in individuality. In the experiment, independent yeast lineages evolved a multicellular “snowflake-like” cluster formed in response to gravity selection. Shortly after the evolution of clusters, the yeast evolved higher rates of cell death. While cell death enables clusters to split apart and form new groups, it also reduces their performance in the face of gravity selection. To understand the selective value of increased cell death, we create a mathematical model of the cellular arrangement within snowflake yeast clusters. The model reveals that the mechanism of cell death and the geometry of the snowflake interact in complex, evolutionarily important ways. We find that the organization of snowflake yeast imposes powerful limitations on the available space for new cell growth. By dying more frequently, cells in clusters avoid encountering space limitations, and, paradoxically, reach higher numbers. In addition, selection for particular group sizes can explain the increased rate of apoptosis both in terms of total cell number and total numbers of collectives. Thus, by considering the geometry of a primitive multicellular organism we can gain insight into the initial emergence of reproductive division of labor during an evolutionary transition in individuality.},

   abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms possess strong problem-solving abilities and have been applied in a wide range of applications. However, they still suffer from a high computational burden and poor generalization ability. To overcome the limitations, numerous studies consider conducting knowledge extraction across distinct optimization task domains. Among these research strands, one representative tributary is evolutionary multi-task optimization (EMTO) that aims to resolve multiple optimization tasks simultaneously. The underlying attribute of implicit parallelism for evolutionary algorithms can well incorporate with the framework of EMTO, giving rise to the ascending EMTO studies. This review is intended to present a detailed exposition on the research in the EMTO area. We reveal the core components for designing the EMTO algorithms. Subsequently, we organize the works lying in the fusions between EMTO and traditional evolutionary algorithms. By analyzing the associations for diverse strategies in different branches of EMTO, this review uncovers the research trends and the potentially important directions, with additional interesting real-world applications mentioned.},

   abstract = {A new formulation for coordinate system independent adaptation of arbitrary normal mutation distributions with zero mean is presented. This enables the evolution strategy (ES) to adapt the correct scaling of a given problem and also ensures invariance with respect to any rotation of the fitness function (or the coordinate system). Especially rotation invariance, here resulting directly from the coordinate system independent adaptation of the mutation distribution, is an essential feature of the ES with regard to its general applicability to complex fitness functions. Compared to previous work on this subject, the introduced formulation facilitates an interpretation of the resulting mutation distribution, making sensible manipulation by the user possible (if desired). Furthermore it enables a more effective control of the overall mutation variance (expected step length).},
